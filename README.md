# Regular Expressions Tutorial

## Description
This tutorial can be used by anyone who wants to learn about using Regex with matching emails and how to utilize it appriprately on JavaScript. I designed this tutorial to be more like an index type of structure. I know that I personally am able to study better when everything is aligned, almost like a key and value format but also including an example to be able to see a real-life problem.
